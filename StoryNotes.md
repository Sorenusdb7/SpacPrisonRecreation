Current Story Script-   
2 Day storyline-Timeline long enough to give an idea of prison life and communicate a feeling of hopelessness, but short enough for a game/app-based short story
Story will take place in Winter   
 - Intro-Introduce Main Character (a prisoner) and briefly give a reason why they were imprisoned (shows how easily and unfairly a person could’ve been imprisoned under the communist regime)   
 - Day 1-Focus on daily life in prison and what standard conditions were like   
    - Wake Up/Roll Call   
    - Working in Mines and workload/mining conditions   
    - End of day/second roll call/Winter conditions/50-person cells   
 - Day 2-Focus on less-daily but still common experiences, and end with feelings of hopelessness   
    - Wake up/Roll Call   
    - Visitation with family member-May be able to add options to bribe guard for better visitation conditions   
    - Something occurs either during visitation or during mining in the day that gets the player in trouble   
    - Isolation Cell/Night in Isolation Cell/End of story-Ends game/story on a low note for emphasized feeling of hopelessness.   
 - Extra Notes-Options to expand the story and create more branches through interactions with prisoners and guards, but this is a main story line to serve as the base point.
    - It’s intended to be basic and communicate the basic ideas we’ve been talking about.   
    - More Storylines can be added by future groups as well   
    - Experiencing other inmates bribing   
    - Future extra storyline/choices can ask the moral questions of what you’d be willing to do to better your situation   
    - Future groups could also maybe add stories from other perspectives like Guards or visiting families
