Our focus was on shifting the digital recreation from a web-based system to an application, and in its current state it lacks features present on the web applications. There are also several features we believe would be good to add in the future.
  
 - Pause Menu: The ability to pause the story would be extremely helpful for users in the event they need to step away from their device part way through. A menu like this would also be a convenient way to access some other features
  
 - Albanian Language: Since the primary audience for this application is Albanians, it would make sense to add an Albanian translation and the option to swap between Albanian and English
  
 - Accessibility Options: Options to slow down or speed up the text, or to change the font used, text size, or text color, could all be added to make the application more accessible to a variety of people.
  
 - Additional Stories: The application currently features one story, showing life in the prison from the perspective of a prisoner. It is difficult to show all areas of the prison in a single story without losing the users attention, so adding multiple stories showing different areas of the prison could allow users to see the full prison over the course of a handful of sittings. These stories could also show off significant events such as the revolt that took place in Spac, or be from the perspective of other people, such as a prison guard.
